# 391 Â· Number of Airplanes in the Sky

Description

Given an list `interval`, which are taking off and landing time of the flight. How many airplanes are there at most at the same time in the sky?

Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [(1, 10), (2, 3), (5, 8), (4, 7)]Output: 3Explanation:The first airplane takes off at 1 and lands at 10.The second ariplane takes off at 2 and lands at 3.The third ariplane takes off at 5 and lands at 8.The forth ariplane takes off at 4 and lands at 7.During 5 to 6, there are three airplanes in the sky.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]Output: 1Explanation: Landing happen before taking off.
```
