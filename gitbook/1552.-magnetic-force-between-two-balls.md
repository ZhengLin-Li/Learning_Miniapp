# 1552. Magnetic Force Between Two Balls

In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has `n` empty baskets, the `ith` basket is at `position[i]`, Morty has `m` balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the **minimum magnetic force** between any two balls is **maximum**.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`.

Given the integer array `position` and the integer `m`. Return _the required force_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/11/q3v1.jpg)

<pre><code><strong>Input: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3
</strong><strong>Output: 3
</strong><strong>Explanation: Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6]. The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2
</strong><strong>Output: 999999999
</strong><strong>Explanation: We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `n == position.length`
* `2 <= n <= 105`
* `1 <= position[i] <= 109`
* All integers in `position` are **distinct**.
* `2 <= m <= position.length`

                if p - prev_position >= force:

                    prev_position = p
            return balls_placed >= m

            mid = (l + r) // 2

                ans = mid
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                r = mid - 1

        return ans
